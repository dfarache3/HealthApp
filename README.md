Health App

This Application aims to create a general applications that tracks micro and macro data that one should intake
Goals:
* Determine nutrient/macros needs of user
* Calculate whether nutrient/macro markers hit based on consumed food
* Grant recipes that enable one to reach said markers
* Save info of each day into file than can be accessed later

These are the main goals but could be expanded to
* Fitness goals and excerses recommendations, including scheduling
* Saving pnatry information to give better recs
* Enables user to set goals

You can always add anything else you want which could include using a foreign data base for food data or expanding the UX design
I thought it would be cool to create an app that can grant all this information that is open source and can add new desired features
More complicated martix or graph structures could also be used as stuff is added
